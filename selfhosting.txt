If you are planning on hosting this bot yourself, there are a few things you need to know...

Firstly, you must credit me somewhere in the bot.
Secondly, these things below are what you need to install

REQUIRED PACKAGES:
Note: Some of these may require you to install other packages. I have not listed these other packages here, they *should* come with them.
      I also may not have listed everything. If I haven't, tell me and I'll update this.
